Surface Water Body Mapping in the Himalayas Region

The planet is warming, from North Pole to South Pole. Since 1906, the global average surface temperature has increased between 1.1 
and 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius)–even more in sensitive Polar Regions. The planet is already suffering from 
some impacts of global warming like Ice is melting worldwide, especially at the Earth’s poles, many species have been impacted by 
rising temperatures, the sea level has been rising more quickly over the last century, and Precipitation (rain and snowfall) has
increased across the globe, on average. Hurricanes and other storms are likely to become stronger. Floods and droughts will become 
more common. And there are lot of other consequences which the planet is going to face in the future because of global warming. 
Global warming appears to be rapidly accelerating temperature elevations in certain high-altitude zones, particularly those nearest
the equator, which includes the Greater Himalayas. The melting of these Himalayan glaciers will have a more direct long-term effect
on the hundreds of millions of people who live along rivers fed by their seasonal runoff. Hence in this project I find the opportunity
to observe the effects of the Global warming on the Himalayas. For this I have selected two study areas named Wular Lake and the Dal 
Lake which are in very very close(less than 30 miles) from the Himalayan Mountain Ranges. The major water source for this lake will 
be the from the newly formed glaciers which happens due to melting of ice. So, by observing the surface area of these lakes over a 
period of time will indicate the rate at which the ice is melting, and the affect Global Warming has on Himalayas. For this project
I have done two tasks. In the first task I have compared two different algorithms for the surface water body mapping one using MNDWI 
vegetative Index and the other using Machine Learning classification techniques like Random forest and SVM (Support vector machines) 
to predict the water body surface for two regions Wullar lake and the Dal lake. In the second task I have done the Time Series Analysis
of Wullar lake from 2013-2017 using MNDWI Vegetative Index to observe the increase in the surface area of the lake. I have found that
with the increase in the no.of training samples for both the classification techniques (Random Forest and SVM) gave us the better results 
because the model is gets trained well.For the time series analysis of Wullar lake the surface area of the is increasing from 2013 to 2017 
except for 2016. This increase in the area is because of the melting of the ice. So, because of increase in global warming the ice is 
melting at the faster rate. Hence, this study projects how important it is for us to protect the environment by decreasing the global
warming.
