Project Overview:

Comparing the two algorithms to identify whether the water bodies are predicted properly or not with the two different methods

1)classification method:

	In this method we train a particular region to identify what is the water body/surface /grassland/forest etc.
	And apply this method to other region in the study area to predict the exact water bodies

2) In the 2nd method it is actually based on the mNDWI index....So this method classifies the water bodies based on the geographic features based on the 
	mNDWI values.

	we can find the threshold of mNDWI values in which the actual water body is detected.Once we know the threshold we can write some if loops 
	and if it is within the threshold then it is the water body
	
	Finally we can plot the surface area covered by both the methods and show the graph

		surface area= Area of each pixel * No.of pixels
		
		Later for the scientific purpose we can compare two regions east and west and compare the results and use the actual study wheater your
		results are correct or not.
